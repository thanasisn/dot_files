# Scrolling and Pagination for **lf** File Previews

![](demo.gif)

`lf-scrollingpreview` is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate scrolling up and down previews of text files. For the sake of clarity this gadget only implements scrolling of text previews. If graphical previews are set up the very same configuration can be used to navigate pages of a pdf or frames of a gif.

## Usage

Run `./lf-scrollingpreview` and use `>` and `<` to scroll down or up, respectively. Optionally, a startup path can be specified. By default, `lf-scrollingpreview` will launch inside the *examples* directory.

**Prerequisites**

+ `zsh` for scripting
